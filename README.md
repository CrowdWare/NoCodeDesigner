# NoCodeDesigner
A no-code application designer built on the NoCodeLib library.

## Overview

NoCodeDesigner is a desktop application that allows users to design applications without writing code. It uses the NoCodeLib library for core functionality and adds specific features for application design.

## Features

- Visual application design
- Component library
- Preview functionality
- Export to various formats

## Plugins
You will find plugin samples [here](https://github.com/CrowdWare/NoCodeDesignerPlugins).

## Development

NoCodeDesigner is built using Kotlin Multiplatform and Compose for Desktop. It uses NoCodeLib as a shared library.

### Building from Source

1. Clone the repository with submodules:
   ```bash
   git clone --recursive https://github.com/crowdware/NoCodeDesigner.git
   ```

2. Build the project:

## ðŸ“¦ Submodules

This repository uses Git submodules to keep shared components synchronized across tools:

### ðŸ§© `nocodelib`

Located at:

```
nocodelib/
```

This is a shared Kotlin Multiplatform library that contains core functionality for rendering, parsing, and working with SML-based UI elements. It is used by both [NoCodeDesigner](https://github.com/CrowdWare/NoCodeDesigner) and [FreeBookDesigner](https://github.com/CrowdWare/FreeBookDesigner), ensuring consistent logic and UI components across tools.

### ðŸ“˜ `sml` (as sub-submodule)

Located inside the `nocodelib` submodule at:

```
nocodelib/composeApp/src/desktopMain/resources/sml
```

This is the [SML (Simple Markdown Language)](https://github.com/CrowdWare/sml) submodule, which contains runtime documentation for all SML elements.

This layout is intentional: the documentation is displayed live in NoCodeDesigner and also used in [smile](https://github.com/CrowdWare/smile) and the submodule ensures that the content only needs to be maintained in one place.

To clone the full repository including all submodules and sub-submodules:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/CrowdWare/NoCodeDesigner.git
cd NoCodeDesigner
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### There is another submodul which we only use temporary
Therefore its not a real github submodule.
We will replace it as soon our own code editor is ready. 
You should check it out on the same level as NoCodeDesigner and build it prior.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/CrowdWare/NoCodeDesignerCodeEditor.git
```
